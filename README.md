# MERN Login System

This project runs down a **a methodical framework** of how to implement an **advanced** authentication system in a _3-tier application architecture_.

This can serve as a boilerplate to bootstrap authentication logic for your next application.

## Technologies used

This project is built using MERN stack.

## How is it an advanced authentication system?

- This project uses JWT based authentication tokens.
- Generation of longer-lived refresh token and shorter-lived access token.
- The refresh token is used to obtain a new Access token when it expires.
- Silent authentication. When access token expires, the user-agent automatically reauthenticates without user intervention.
- Forgot password/password reset.
- Logout from all Devices.
- Redux Toolkit for State Management.
- Implement success/error notifications once, and it works everywhere without more boilerplate code.

## Getting Started

<!-- A **methodical guide** on how to create the modern day authentication Logic for <strong>Single Page Applications(SPA<small>s</small>)</strong> that communicate with <strong>API<small>s</small></strong>. -->

Get started with testing APIs quickly by importing `postman_collection_API.json` into [Postman](https://www.postman.com/company/about-postman/) app.
